# Home-Assistant-Configuration
This is my configuration file for the awesome [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io).

It currently is a WIP, since there are a number of things left to do.

### TODO
- [ ] Split up config more
- [ ] Add config check before restarting
- [ ] Use sensor from `command_line` to check wether new changes should get pulled
- [ ] Increase `command_line` sensor interval
- [ ] Clean up
- [ ] Add README's in subfolders (to explain some more)
- [ ] Add screenshots
- [ ] Add summary list of devices/services
- [ ] Get more devices to integrate
