# Automation
This folder holds all my automation files.

### [Free space](free_space.yaml)
This automation will trigger when the available space on my server gets below 100GB.
Once this threshold is reached I should start cleaning up my Plex library.

### [Update Available](update_available.yaml)
This automation triggers when there is a new update available for HA.
*NOTE*: This currently is broken, check this [issue](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/issues/4747).
